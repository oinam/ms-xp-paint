_**Note: This is a fan project based on my nostalgia for the amazing Windows XP OS, but is in no way affiliated with Microsoft**_

This is a web-based version of [MS Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) for Windows XP. It is a fork of [JS Paint](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint), with the following differences:

 * It is self contained in a single .html file (~1 MB in size).
 * It is fully usable offline.
 * It removes many excess features from JS Paint that are not in the actual Windows XP MS Paint (besides a few features, such as rendering GIFs and increased history).
 * It is much lighter than JS Paint (since it only includes the essential features).
 * It is Windows XP styled instead of Windows 95 styled.

# Development (Build from Source)

Prerequisites:

 * [monolith](https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith) to be installed and on the path. 
 * NodeJS v10+

```
npm install
node build.js
```
